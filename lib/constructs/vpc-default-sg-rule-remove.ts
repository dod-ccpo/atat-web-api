 * any ENI in this Security Group will not be able to send or receive traffic unless granted
 * by another Security Group.
 *
 * Constructs that add rules to the VPC's default Security Group should depend on this if
 * those rules should be kept; otherwise, this should depend on any constructs that create
 * rules on the default Security Group that should be deleted.
 *
 * This is implemented as a custom resource in a VPC. It will need network access to make
 * EC2 and S3 API calls, as well as possibly CloudFormation.
