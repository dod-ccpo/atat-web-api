# ATAT Web API
The ATAT Web API is the internal application programming interface that supports the [ATAT Web UI](https://github.com/dod-ccpo/atat-web-ui). This API will invoke the [ATAT CSP Orchestration](https://github.com/dod-ccpo/atat-csp-orchestration) layer.

## ATAT Serverless PoC
The team is building a temporary proof of concept to demonstrate the breadth of serverless technologies that we expect
to use when we roll out the first sets of internal APIs. It can be found in `./poc`. 

### Prerequisites:
* Node Version Manager
  ```
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
  ```
  Then restart your shell.\
  Details available at [Installing and Updating](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) in the nvm README.
  
* Node.js
  ```
  nvm install
  ```
  Node.js version is specified in file .nvmrc
* Serverless Framework
  ```
  npm install -g serverless
  ```
* Typescript
  ```
  npm install -g typescript
  ```
* Azure CLI\
  Follow steps at [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) at microsoft.com
---
### Deploying
#### Install npm dependencies
```
cd ./poc/random_quote
npm ci
```

---

#### Login to Azure and set subscription
```
az login
az account set -s <subscription-id>
```

#### Create Azure Service Principal and set environment variables

Follow steps at [Creating a Service Principal](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/azure/guide/quick-start#creating-a-service-principal) at serverless.com

---


#### Deploy app (and repeat as needed iteratively)
```
sls deploy --stage <your-stage-name> --region 'East US'
```

This should create all resources described in `./poc/random_quote/serverless.yml`, which represents a single
microservice. As of this writing (July 1, 2021), this consists of the following instances:
* App Insights
* Function App
* Storage Account
* App Service Plan
* API Management Service

### Expected Output

```
Serverless: Deployed serverless functions:
Serverless: -> Function App not ready. Retry 0 of 30...
Serverless: -> Function App not ready. Retry 1 of 30...
Serverless: -> Function App not ready. Retry 2 of 30...
Serverless: -> Function App not ready. Retry 3 of 30...
Serverless: -> Function App not ready. Retry 4 of 30...
Serverless: -> Function App not ready. Retry 5 of 30...
Serverless: -> Function App not ready. Retry 6 of 30...
Serverless: -> get: [GET] atat-sls-poc-js-eus-dev-atat-js-fallback-jts.azurewebsites.net/api/get
Serverless: -> post: [POST] atat-sls-poc-js-eus-dev-atat-js-fallback-jts.azurewebsites.net/api/post
```

### Troubleshooting
#### Deploying Hanging
Note that we have observed that on initial deployments, Azure does not appear to actually create the Functions until
we navigate to the `Functions` blade within the Function App that was created. This means that the deployment will get 
stuck and eventually time out after 30 retries. The work-around is just to go into the `Functions` blade once the 
Function App is available.

### Deploying Locally
Use the `offline` capability of Serverless Framework. Note that there appears to be a bug that leaves generated
`function.json` files around at `random_quote/get` and `random_quote/post`, which would otherwise be deleted during the
package process.

```
sls offline
```
